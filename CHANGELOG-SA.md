# Featured fixes

Fixes marked with ➕ are supported in 1.0, Steam, and Rockstar Games Launcher versions. Fixes without that symbol require 1.0.
Fixes marked with ⚙️ can be configured/toggled via the INI file. These options are enabled by default unless stated otherwise.

## Critical fixes
Compatibility issues, crashes, progression blockers.

* ➕ The 14ms frame delay has been removed. As a result, the game now locks properly on 30 FPS instead of 25 FPS.
* ➕ More precise frame limiter, reducing lag spikes a bit when playing with the Frame Limiter on.
* ➕ The mouse should not lock up randomly when exiting the menu on newer systems anymore.
* ➕ DirectPlay dependency has been removed - this should improve compatibility with Windows 8 and newer.
* ➕ Path to the User Files directory is now obtained using a dedicated API call rather than a legacy registry entry, future-proofing the games more.
* ➕ Fixed an issue that would cause games to freeze if III/VC/SA were running at the same time.
* ➕ Fixed an occasional crash when minimizing the game while standing next to a mirror.
* ➕ Fixed a crash on car explosions - most likely to happen when playing with a multi-monitor setup.
* ➕ Fixed a crash when entering advanced display options on a dual monitor machine after: starting the game on the primary monitor in maximum resolution, exiting, starting again in maximum resolution on the secondary monitor. The secondary monitor's maximum resolution had to be greater than the maximum resolution of the primary monitor.
* ➕ Fixed an occasional crash occurring when standing next to escalators.
* ➕ Fixed a crash occurring when the vending machine was continuously used for an extended period.
* ➕ Fixed a streaming-related deadlock, which could occasionally result in the game being stuck on a black screen when entering or exiting interiors (this is the issue people used to fix by setting CPU affinity to one core).
* ➕ A significant memory leak when taking photos with an in-game camera has been fixed.
* ➕ Fixed a crash that occurred when mashing the replay button near groups of gang members holding items.
* ➕ Fixed a crash that occurred when starting a cutscene after playing a replay where CJ wore different clothes from what he is currently wearing.
* ➕ Fixed a crash that occurred when playing back a replay with CJ having a different body type (fat/muscular/normal) than his current one.
* Game timers now tick more accurately, making them not freeze if the framerate exceeds 1000 frames per second; in other words, this fixes occasional freezes on fadeouts if playing with the Frame Limiter off.
* A heap corruption in one place is now fixed (did not affect gameplay but could potentially make the game crash).
* Traveling far away from the map will no longer trigger the extra gang territories glitch, nor will it corrupt the Taxi Driver submission.
* A 1.0 no-DVD-only bug where recruiting gang members would stop working after activating a replay has been fixed (contributed by **Wesser**).
* Fixed a 1.01 only tiny memory leak which occurred every time the player switched a radio station.
* ⚙️ The gym glitch ("You have worked out enough..." showing infinitely) has been fixed.
* ⚙️ Saving in Madd Dogg's mansion will no longer trigger the missing basketball glitch.
* ⚙️ Fixed an occasional soft lock in "Mountain Cloud Boys" - the player will not freeze after arriving at the meeting anymore.
* ⚙️ Possible soft lock in "Sweet's Girl" initial cutscene fixed.
* ⚙️ Fixed a script error in how Driving and Bike Schools destroyed the cones used in lessons, where random objects from the map could be destroyed instead. This glitch was most famously known as the "Blackboard glitch" (contributed by **Wesser**).
* ⚙️ Fixed a script error in "Air Raid" where the player's heavy weapon (like a minigun) would disappear after the mission.

## Other fixes
All the remaining, non-critical fixes.

* ➕ The mouse's vertical axis does not lock during camera fade-ins now.
* ➕ Fixed sun lens flare effect not appearing with AMD/Intel graphics cards.

* ➕ Some car panels now swing after the car's explosion (like they were meant to be but the code forcibly fixed them immediately after damage).
* ➕ <kbd>Num5</kbd> is now bindable (like in the 1.01 patch).
* ➕ Fixed a glitch where random cars would end up being impounded to the garage, replacing player's vehicles.

* ➕ Mirror reflection doesn't break with Anti-Aliasing enabled anymore.
* ➕ With Visual FX Quality set to Very High, mirror reflection quality has been bumped.
* ➕ The Anti-Aliasing option has been altered - instead of listing 1, 2, and 3 options (which in fact are 2x/2x/4x MSAA), the game will now show proper MSAA values from 2x up to 16x (depending on max MSAA level supported by the graphics card).
* ➕ Colliding with another car will now damage proper parts on both cars - previously, both cars got damaged the same way.

* ➕ <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>F4</kbd> now works properly.
* ➕ `FILE_FLAG_NO_BUFFERING` flag has been removed from IMG reading functions - speeding up streaming.
* ➕ Metric-to-imperial conversion constants have been replaced with more accurate ones.
* ➕ Dancing minigame timings have been improved, now they do not lose accuracy over time depending on the PC's uptime.
* ➕ Car generators placed in interiors are now placed correctly - this 'unhides' two vehicles in Madd Dogg's mansion, which were always there but they were not visible.
* ➕ Bombs in cars stored in garages now save properly.
* ➕ Streaming has been greatly improved during Supply Lines mission (or more general, any time when using an RC vehicle) - it now behaves as expected, as opposed to displaying LODs way too quickly.

* ➕ Quadbike's handlebar movement now matches CJ's steering animations when driving at low speeds (contributed by **Wesser**).
* ➕ Fixed the sitting radio station change animation playing in boats where CJ stands upright (contributed by **Wesser**).
* ➕ Pickups, car generators, and stunt jumps spawned through the text IPL files now reinitialize on a New Game. Most notably, this fixes several pickups (like fire extinguishers) going missing after starting a new game.

* ➕ Fixed an issue where biker cops kept shooting at the player even after losing the wanted level.

* ➕ Script randomness is now 16-bit instead of 15-bit.
* ➕ Fixed black shooting stars, they are now white as originally intended.
* ➕ Improved the behavior of exploded cars losing their wheels - now the car sinks from the side of the detached wheel instead of always sinking from the front left side. The rear right wheel can now also be detached during an explosion.
* ➕ Slightly improved the spawning logic of planes. While they can still crash after spawning, this should now occur less frequently.
* ➕ Hovering with a jetpack is now possible using the keyboard controls by holding the next/previous weapon buttons simultaneously (<kbd>Q</kbd> + <kbd>E</kbd> by default).
* ➕ In missions set during the riots, gang members in the player's group will no longer be targeted by the police helicopter, fixing a glitch where they'd abandon the player unexpectedly.
* ➕ Fixed a bug where stealing the car from the passenger side while holding the throttle and/or brake button would kill the driver, or briefly resurrect them if they were already dead.
* ➕ Credits now scale to resolution correctly.
* ➕ Mission title and 'Mission Passed' texts now stay on screen for the same duration, regardless of screen resolution.

* Animated engine components on Bandito, BF Injection, and Hotknife will not animate if the engine is off.
* Firetruck (firela variant) now has a functional ladder - it can be raised by moving the right analog stick down/pressing <kbd>Num2</kbd>.

* Tug now has a functional tow bar (the model has a hook dummy which was not functional until now).
* DFT-30 left middle wheel now displays properly (the game now accepts a typo present in its hierarchy).
* Dumper's suspension is now animated (the game now accepts a typo present in its hierarchy).
* Uranus tail light coronas are now placed correctly, instead of lighting up in the car's interior (the game now accepts a typo present in its hierarchy).

* Lights now get cast on vehicles and peds properly - previously, they would disappear under some conditions.
